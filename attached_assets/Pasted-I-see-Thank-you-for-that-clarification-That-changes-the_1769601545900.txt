I see! Thank you for that clarification. That changes the strategy slightly because **you** are now the "heartbeat" of the data.

Since the system relies on you clicking that button to calculate the growth (Current vs. Previous), the "Trending" list will only be as accurate as your clicking routine.

Here is my revised recommendation for your manual workflow:

### 1. The "Once-a-Day" Routine (Recommended)

Even though it's manual, I still suggest clicking it **once every 24 hours** (e.g., every morning when you start work).

* **Why?** This keeps the "Trending" period consistent. If you click it once a day, your "Trending Score" effectively shows the **Top Gainers of the last 24 hours**.
* **The "CoinMarketCap" Effect:** If you click it at random times (e.g., once after 2 hours, then once after 3 days), the percentages will be all over the place and won't accurately reflect "Social Heat."

### 2. The "Weekend Peak" Strategy

If you want to save your Apify credits and don't want to click every day:

* Click it **once on Friday morning** (to set the baseline).
* Click it **once on Monday morning** (to capture the weekend travel buzz).
* This will show which spots were the most popular over the entire weekend.

### 3. Why it’s actually "Safe" to click often

With only **44 locations**, you don't need to worry about "breaking" anything or spending too much.

* Each click likely takes about 2–5 minutes to finish the scrape.
* Even if you clicked it every single day, you would only be doing ~1,300 lookups a month. This easily fits within the $30/month budget you mentioned (and likely even fits into a free trial/tier).

### A Strategic Suggestion: "The Retirement Plan"

Since you are using Replit, you can actually tell your AI developer to **automate this** so you never have to remember to click it again.

If you want to stop being the "manual sync-er," you can give Replit this prompt:

> "The Instagram trending feature currently requires a manual button click. I want to automate this. Please add a **Cron Job** (using `node-cron` or a simple `setInterval`) in `server/index.ts` that automatically triggers the `updateSocialTrends` function once every 24 hours at 2:00 AM."

**How does that sound?** If you prefer the manual control for now, just stick to the **"One Click Every Morning"** routine to keep your Trending data looking professional and consistent!
