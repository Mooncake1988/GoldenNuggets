That screenshot from Replit looks like you've got a solid "Green Light" on the initial environment setup! It’s great to see your AI developer is ready to roll.

Since we've settled on the **`feat/instagram-trending-spots`** branch and the goal of creating a "Top Gainers" list for your locations, I’ve prepared the **technical blueprint** you can hand over to Replit.

This ensures the AI doesn't just "guess" how to build it, but follows the specific data structure required for a trending algorithm.

---

### **1. Database Schema Update (`shared/schema.ts`)**

We need to track three specific things: the **Instagram Hashtag** for that spot, the **current post count**, and the **previous post count** (to calculate the growth percentage).

**Tell Replit:** *"Update the `locations` table in `shared/schema.ts` to include these fields:"*

```typescript
// Add these to the locations table definition
instagramHashtag: text("instagram_hashtag"),
currentPostCount: integer("current_post_count").default(0),
previousPostCount: integer("previous_post_count").default(0),
socialLastUpdated: timestamp("social_last_updated"),
trendingScore: integer("trending_score").default(0), // Calculated % growth

```

### **2. The Trending Logic (The "Secret Sauce")**

To make it look like CoinMarketCap, Replit needs to create a function that calculates the "Heat Index."

**Tell Replit:** *"Create a utility function to calculate the Trending Score whenever we fetch new data:"*

> **Note:** If a spot goes from 1,000 to 1,100 posts, it gets a score of **10**. We then sort your homepage by the highest score!

---

### **3. The Data Fetching Strategy (Apify Integration)**

Since we are leaning towards **Apify**, you'll need to provide Replit with an API key once you sign up.

**Tell Replit:** *"Prepare a service in `server/routes.ts` that uses the Apify Instagram Scraper. It should loop through all locations that have an `instagramHashtag` and update their counts once every 24 hours."*

---

### **4. Frontend: The "Trending" Badge (`LocationCard.tsx`)**

Finally, we want to show the users that a spot is "Hot."

**Tell Replit:** *"In `client/src/components/LocationCard.tsx`, add a logic to display a '🔥 Trending' badge if the `trendingScore` is above 5%."*

---

### **What I think about the Replit progress:**

Replit is excellent at "boilerplate," but it can sometimes over-complicate API calls. By giving it this **specific schema** and the **Trending Score formula**, you are keeping the "brain" of LekkerSpots focused on your Lo-Fi, authentic vision while using high-tech data under the hood.

**Would you like me to generate the full `schema.ts` file with these updates included so you can just copy-paste it into Replit?**
