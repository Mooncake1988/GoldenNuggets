### **The Story Behind LekkerSpots**

**It started with a VW Polo and a messy notes problem.**

LekkerSpots was born out of a simple love for exploration. For the last few years, I’ve spent at least one weekend a month exploring the Western Cape in my VW Polo. Sometimes the goal is to find a brand new location; other times, it’s just to visit a regular cottage to recharge, escape the city noise, and get a digital detox.

I’ve always been curious. When I drive on the N7 and spot a dirt road, I find myself making a note, checking Google Maps to see where it leads, and looking for accommodation nearby.

The problem was that my "system" was a mess. I had saved pins in Google Maps, bookmarks on Booking.com and Airbnb, random notes in Google Docs and Evernote, and literal Post-it notes. The information was scattered across various mediums, and I'd constantly forget where I saved a point of interest.

So I decided it was time for a single source of truth.

In essence, LekkerSpots is my personal travel diary, made public. It is the home for all the "lekker spots" I've found and want to share, consolidating my earlier passion projects, *ilovecederberg.co.za* and *bathtubswithaview.co.za*.

**What You’ll Find Here**   
I believe travel is about discovery. This is where I share my personal list of hidden gems—the authentic places and unique experiences I’ve found off the beaten path, far from the recycled tourist traps.

Whether you are a fellow curious mind who wonders "where does that dirt road go?", or an on-the-go adventurer looking for a quick guide, this is for you. From that perfect, cozy artisan coffee shop and breathtaking hikes to vibrant local markets and the ideal spot for a recharge.

This is a collection of stories and spots worth sharing, powered by genuine, first-hand experience.
