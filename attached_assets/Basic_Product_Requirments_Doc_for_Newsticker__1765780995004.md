# **Basic Product Requirements Doc for Newsticker Feature**

* For my travel web app [LekkerSpots.co.za](http://lekkerspots.co.za) I would like to add a news ticker to the home page. We could use the news ticker for latest news announcements related to LekkerSpots, latest locations or even advertisements etc. The news ticker also gives the web app a bit more motion and I think this improves general UX when a user visits the home page.  
* Please suggest categories we could use for the news ticker.  
* The news ticker should only be visible on the homepage for now.  
* Create a new dashboard for the news ticker. We already have an admin dashboard so we can place it there or create a new section.  
* The news ticker should be colorful and move at a speed that can be read easily by the human eye.   
* When a user hovers over the news ticker it pauses.  
* The news ticker should be placed below the navigation bar on the homepage.   
* When the admin creates an item for the news ticker, the admin should be able to paste a URL so when the user clicks on the news ticker item, it pauses and the user can click on the item.  
* As the user scrolls down, the news ticker is sticky and is attached to the navbar so it is always visible.  
* If no items are active for the news ticker, then there should be no news ticker visible.   
* I am open to suggestions and ideas on how to utilize the newsticker  
* I have uploaded a reference and example of an announcement or new ticker dashboard I built with Replit ai agent as well. See screenshots.
